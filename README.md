gaf-project
===========

This is a (currently Perl/Gtk2+) program which aims to marry `gschem` and `pcb-rnd` together into a single
coherent system.  It facilitates the management of a project as a single entity and automate the transfer 
of the schematics from `gschem` into `pcb-rnd` at the touch of a button.  It also provides a few useful
automated export functions (Schematic as PCB, PCB as Gerber files, and [requiring extra un-published software,
so don't use it] export to PNGs/SVGs for Blender rendering).

It is still very much a work-in-progress, and will eventually be converted to pure C instead of Perl.
